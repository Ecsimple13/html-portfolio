<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a graduate of Bachelor Of Science in Engineering Technology Management and currently employed in a Logistic Firm as a Regional Program Exceutive</p>

<p>To finish a degree as a Software Engineer & being able to build my own website has always been my dream career, but due to financial constrainst, I wasn't able to follow the said path.</p>

<p>Now as a working individual, I took off the courage to search on the internet the available platforms on which I could go back to what I truly wanted when I was a kid. And here it goes, I found Udemy and now thankfully, starting to make tiny bits of steps to becoming a Web Developer.</p>
